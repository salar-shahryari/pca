# pca
This repository contains a simple and educational example of applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the classic Iris dataset using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library. The notebook walks through essential steps for:

    Loading and standardizing the Iris dataset.

    Performing dimensionality reduction using PCA to project the data into two principal components.

    Visualizing the resulting 2D principal component space, colored by target class (Iris species).

This example is ideal for learners aiming to understand the basics of PCA for exploratory data analysis and visualization in machine learning and data science workflows.
